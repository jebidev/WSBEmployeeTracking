User Stories
- Story 1 - As an admin user (WSB staff), I need an interface that allows for easy access to all events, along with a way to accept or deny upcoming events. I would like to be able to see which employers are coming to what events, and how often they have attended events at WSB. This should be an easy to follow interface that also allows us to update any upcoming events, and view attendance for these events. This will benefit us that we have easy access to all information regarding events hosted by employers, along with quick acceptance and denial of events.
- Story 2 - As a student user, I want to be able to see a nice event calendar for the Business School. The GUI should be easy to navigate and show me all the info about employers and events on a simple layout.
- Story 3 - As an employer user, I want to be able to edit add/edit event details such as date, time, location, and description to keep the information accurate. I also want to be able to communicate with my attendees through a notification system that is clean and simple.

Sprint Review
What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
    - We learned that it can be easy to check our group progress by using multiple branches to see everyone's updates. We also learned that time management can be difficult when we are all studying for our exams.
What did go well? Why?
    - Website was completed on time. Everyone is happy with the progress that we made on the website this semester. We were also happy to see an improvement in our code quality throughout the process.
What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?
    - A few things broke when doing merges. We often had conflicting tasks occuring across different branches that would get changed based on when they were merged into main.
How can you make things better next time?
    - Work on managing time better between tasks.
Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
    - We are extremely satisfied with the work we have completed. We are really happy to see the progress we have all made as a team.
Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
    - We reviewed Group 11 and their project about Habitat for Humanity. We liked how their project added in pagination. The sign-up modal looks really clean, and we liked how the app looks. We also liked the entire design across the app; they kept the sections uniform and it was easy to follow the flow throughout the app. We did not notice any errors or flaws in the apps current state. The entire team was present to showcase their design.
