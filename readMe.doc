User Stories
- Story 1 - As an admin user (WSB staff), I need an interface that allows for easy access to all events, along with a way to accept or deny upcoming events. I would like to be able to see which employers are coming to what events, and how often they have attended events at WSB. This should be an easy to follow interface that also allows us to update any upcoming events, and view attendance for these events. This will benefit us that we have easy access to all information regarding events hosted by employers, along with quick acceptance and denial of events.
- Story 2 - As a student user, I want to be able to see a nice event calendar for the Business School. The GUI should be easy to navigate and show me all the info about employers and events on a simple layout.
- Story 3 - As an employer user, I want to be able to edit add/edit event details such as date, time, location, and description to keep the information accurate. I also want to be able to communicate with my attendees through a notification system that is clean and simple.

Spring Review (April 14, 2024):
What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
    - We learned that teamwork and patience can be incredibly helpful when working on projects collaboratively. We also learned how to be more proactive in our approach to completeing the project. We also learned the importance of communication, especially when working on different parts of the project. This can be in sending text updates of what we have worked on or thorough our meetings throughout the sprint.

What did go well? Why?
    - Each part of the website has come together well; the one page HTML was a smooth transition from having multiple completed pages. The bulma and css have been very seamlessly coming together, thanks to extra work done over spring break by Jing. We have also had a lot better time management this time around, understanding that everyone has other work come up.

What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?
    - Still can be hard to plan meetings with other schoolwork; we also had issues with remembering things from IS 371 since most of us took the course years ago. This is just due to busy schedules and most of us having taken IS 371 freshman or sophomore year. 

How can you make things better next time?
    - Plan meetings further ahead of time.

Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
    - Yes, we are satisfied with our work so far. We showed the client the website and he was very impressed with our work so far. 

Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
    - We reviewed Group 11 and their project about Habitat for Humanity. We like the design of the website and the functionality of the website. We really liked how they implemented a calendar for events into their website. We did notice a typo on the About Page where "introduction" is spelt "intoriduction". We loved all the photos of dogs on the webpage, and the posts page. We liked the inclusion of links to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The entire team was present to showcase their design.
