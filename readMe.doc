User Stories
- Story 1 - As an admin user (WSB staff), I need an interface that allows for easy access to all events, along with a way to accept or deny upcoming events. I would like to be able to see which employers are coming to what events, and how often they have attended events at WSB. This should be an easy to follow interface that also allows us to update any upcoming events, and view attendance for these events. This will benefit us that we have easy access to all information regarding events hosted by employers, along with quick acceptance and denial of events.
- Story 2 - As a student user, I want to be able to see a nice event calendar for the Business School. The GUI should be easy to navigate and show me all the info about employers and events on a simple layout.
- Story 3 - As an employer user, I want to be able to edit add/edit event details such as date, time, location, and description to keep the information accurate. I also want to be able to communicate with my attendees through a notification system that is clean and simple.
